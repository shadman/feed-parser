
Dear Shadman,

As informed we would like to proceed with you to the next step in our application process. Our coding assessment.

The coding assessment we would like you to do is attached to this message. The assessment consists of two main parts:

1) the creation of the interface and MVC; 
2) the processing of the product feed.

The main purpose of this assessment is to understand how you think in regards to data processing. The product feed contains over 1 million items and the main goal is to process as much data, with as little resources as possible. We are looking forward to understand how you would approach this challenge and of course how your code looks like. Additionally, be sure to check the restrictions chapter in the document, specifically “the frameworks that are allowed”.

The average amount of time for the assessment is about 4 to 6 hours. You have up to 10 days maximum to finish the assessment, from today. We’ll be focusing on the design choices and your solution to the problem.

One small piece of advice when it comes to testing/debugging: instead of downloading the complete product feed from the URL in the document, you can download a much smaller version by adding the parameter “limit=N” to the download URL, where N is the number of products you want to be included in the feed. For example: 
http://pf.tradetracker.net/?aid=1&type=xml&encoding=utf-8&fid=251713&categoryType=2&additionalType=2&limit=10

Should you have any questions, please do let me know. I’ll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

For now I wish you good luck and looking forward to the submitted result which can be sent to me personally.

Best regards,
